Webapp using django framework.
Webapp should have multiple images displayed on home page, of multiple items. 
Hovering on image should show item's name. 
Clicking on each image should open a popup with brief description of the content related to item. 
Read more option should go to a new page where the entire page is dedicated to details of that item. 
You can think of what elements can be added in the dedicated page, eventually.
